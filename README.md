# OOPs_Challenge

In this project, I have used java to create a class Car and detect collision between two objects
Cartesian system of coordinates have been used for this task along with basic vector operations

The Car object is treated as a point particle having only integer coordinates which is a bit less than ideal but it is what the problem required
The collision of two cars is defined when both of them are along a trajectory which takes them to the same point in space
It is important to note that at the time of collision both the cars are supposed to be in the same instance of time and the time of collision returns the 
expected time from the time of observation at which the cars will collide
